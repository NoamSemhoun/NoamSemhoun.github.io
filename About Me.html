  <h4 style="margin: 5%;" id="text">
    I had the experience of several projects in FullStack, which brought me a large number of skills in Web development. 
    <br>The field of Big data, RL and Machine learning is really what interests and excites me. 
    That si the one I continue to train myself in, and I’m planning to acquire skills again.
<br><br> On the other hand, do not recruit a candidate only for their skills but for their state of mind because skills can always be learned... 
My state of spirit is « great motivation », I am constantly looking for surpassing myself, 
I’m invested and serious in all my activities.*

       I am passionate about music and sports that I practice in several possible forms.<br> 
      They are my two main hobbies that I have had since I was young <br> and they still occupy a large part of my free time today.
       <br>They allow me to escape, have fun and express myself, and I am happy to be able to share these passions with my friends or my family.
<br> <br>For example, I have been playing football very regularly since I was little like this photo;)
<br>
I think that sport is also essential for optimal work and a good state of mind. <br>
